# Getting Started with Solutions

::: tip Prerequisites
To use any the Example Solutions, you must have a **PagerDuty Runbook Automation** (Self-Hosted or SaaS) instance available.

If you do not have a license for either of these products, [contact us](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/runbook-automation/) to learn more.

**You must be running a [currently supported product version](/history/release-calendar.md) at a minimum.**  Specific jobs may require specific product versions due to newer plugin releases.  Those will be captured in the job's descriptions.

New instances of Runbook Automation Cloud have the Solution installed and included by default. [Request a Trial here](https://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up/runbook-automation/)<br>
