# Storage Management

### Overview

Technology users and leaders face challenges with time-consuming and error-prone manual processes when managing storage across various systems.  Without automation managing storage across complex systems requires significant effort and risks operational inefficiencies, and service disruptions.

### Use Cases

- **List Top Disk Consuming Files**: Allows teams to quickly pinpoint storage issues, optimize resources, and prevent costly downtime.
- **Provision New Data Storage**: Ensures consistent, secure configurations across environments, reducing setup time and operational risks.
- **Log Rotation and Clean Up**: Enables timely and efficient management of log data, preventing storage bloat and ensuring that critical logs remain accessible.
- **De-provisioning Storage**: Ensures consistent, accurate cleanup of unused storage, reducing costs and enhancing data security by minimizing exposure.
